# CLAUDE.md — TeamBrewer

This file orients any agent (or human) working in this repository. **Read it fully before acting.**

## What this project is

TeamBrewer is a private, invite-only web app that helps competitive **Trading Card Game teams** work
together to crack the meta and pick the best decks for each important tournament. Primary game:
**Flesh and Blood** (Riftbound designed-for, built later). One instance hosts **multiple isolated
teams (workspaces)** that never see each other's data.

The authoritative description of the product, domain, architecture, and decisions lives in
[`docs/`](docs/README.md). **`docs/` is the source of truth — this file only tells you how to work.**

## Current state

The knowledge base and the phased implementation plan are complete. **Phase-00 (foundation) is done:**
the pnpm monorepo, strict TypeScript, lint/format, the Vitest + Testcontainers + Playwright test harness,
Prisma 7 with an empty base migration, the NestJS API (`GET /api/health`), the React + Vite PWA shell, and
the Docker Compose stack (Postgres + API + Nginx) all exist and pass locally.

**Phase-01 (auth & tenancy) is ✅ done** on branch `phase-01-auth-and-tenancy` (not yet merged to `main`).
Delivered and tested (140 unit/integration tests + the canonical Playwright e2e, all local-green): the
identity/tenancy models + migration; **Better Auth** (password + mandatory TOTP + backup codes, invite-only,
no-email) and the **Discord** login method (custom OAuth claim/link transport, invite-only + method
exclusivity); the **tenant-isolation backbone** (`TeamContextGuard` + `TeamScopedPrisma`) and the
management-side **`TeamAdminGuard`** ("Option C" path-scoped admin routes — the isolation guard keeps no
bypass); the admin (teams/accounts/membership, last-admin 422), onboarding-link, and self endpoints; rate
limiting on sensitive routes; and the **frontend** (auth pages, active-team context + selector, admin
console, account settings). Next: **phase-02 (card database)** — pick it up per
[`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/README.md).

## How to work in this repo

1. **Before implementing a phase**, read, in order:
   - The phase plan in [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/README.md) (e.g. `phase-03-decks.md`).
   - Every feature spec it references in [`docs/features/`](docs/features/).
   - The ADRs it references in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).
   - The relevant architecture docs in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/).
2. **Follow the coding rules** in [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/):
   - [`coding-standards.md`](.claude/rules/coding-standards.md)
   - [`testing.md`](.claude/rules/testing.md)
   - [`git-and-commits.md`](.claude/rules/git-and-commits.md)
   - [`security-and-tenancy.md`](.claude/rules/security-and-tenancy.md)
   - [`data-sources.md`](.claude/rules/data-sources.md)
3. **Use the project skills** in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/):
   - `start-next-phase` — say **"start the next phase"** to run the next phase end-to-end (autonomously
     where safe) and update the progress trackers. Wraps `implementing-a-phase`.
   - `implementing-a-phase` — the read-first, test-first, commit-atomically workflow for one phase.
   - `adding-a-feature-module` — the standard NestJS module + web feature structure.
   - `working-with-card-data` — card-data sync, search, and preview.
4. **When something is unclear, ask.** Do not guess at requirements. Keep `docs/` correct: if you change
   a decision, update the doc and the ADR in the same commit.

## Non-negotiables (the short list — full detail in the rules and ADRs)

- **Tenant isolation is a security property.** Every domain row is scoped by `teamId`; scoping is
  enforced **server-side** from the authenticated session, never from a client-supplied value. No
  endpoint may return cross-team data. See [`docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Explicit, readable names.** Never abbreviate variables, functions, or identifiers. Names reflect the
  business domain (`confidenceWeight`, not `cw`).
- **Test-first and well tested.** No feature is "done" without meaningful tests, including tenant-isolation
  tests. See [`docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md).
- **No scraping.** External decks are referenced by link only; card data comes from sanctioned open
  sources. Respect every third party's terms of service. See [ADR-0007](docs/decisions/0007-external-data-approach.md).
- **Decks are links, not card lists.** The app is not a deck builder. See [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-decks-as-links.md).
- **Prefer current documentation.** For any library/framework/API choice, check current (2026) official
  docs rather than relying on memory — the ecosystem moves fast.
- **Local-first; the remote is deferred.** Everything must build, run, test, and be verified with no git
  remote. Integrate by merging branches into `main` locally; **do not create or push to a remote unless the
  user explicitly asks.** CI (GitHub Actions) activates only once a remote exists; until then the bar is the
  local `pnpm` checks. See [`.claude/rules/git-and-commits.md`](.claude/rules/git-and-commits.md).

## Layout (created in phase-00)

```
apps/
  web/        # React + Vite SPA (PWA)
  api/        # NestJS backend (Prisma under apps/api/prisma)
packages/
  shared/     # Zod schemas + TypeScript types shared by web and api
infra/nginx/  # Nginx config (serves the web build, proxies /api)
docs/         # This knowledge base (source of truth)
.claude/      # Rules, skills, settings for agents
.github/      # CI workflow (activates once a remote exists)
mise.toml     # Pins the toolchain (see below)
docker-compose.yml
```

## Toolchain

Node and pnpm are pinned via **mise** (`mise.toml`): **Node 26.5.0** and **pnpm 11.11.0**, mirrored in
`package.json` (`engines` + `packageManager`) for corepack/CI. TypeScript is pinned to **6.0.3** (not 7.x):
typescript-eslint 8 supports `typescript <6.1.0`, so the native TS 7 compiler would break typed linting.
With mise activated in your shell, `pnpm`/`node` resolve to these pinned versions automatically.

## Commands

- `pnpm install` — install workspace dependencies
- `pnpm dev` — run web + api in watch mode
- `pnpm build` — build all packages (shared → api/web, topological)
- `pnpm test` — run unit/integration tests (Vitest; api integration uses Testcontainers Postgres)
- `pnpm test:e2e` — run end-to-end tests (Playwright; needs Docker — spins up a Testcontainers Postgres and the API)
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` — static checks (ESLint / tsc)
- `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:write` — Prettier check / write
- `pnpm --filter @teambrewer/api db:migrate` — apply database migrations (`prisma migrate dev`)
- `pnpm --filter @teambrewer/api db:generate` — regenerate the Prisma client
- `docker compose up --build` — run the full self-hosted stack (web on `WEB_PORT`, default 8080)
