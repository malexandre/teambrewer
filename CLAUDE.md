# CLAUDE.md — TeamBrewer

This file orients any agent (or human) working in this repository. **Read it fully before acting.**

## What this project is

TeamBrewer is a private, invite-only web app that helps competitive **Trading Card Game teams** work
together to crack the meta and pick the best decks for each important tournament. Primary game:
**Flesh and Blood** (Riftbound designed-for, built later). One instance hosts **multiple isolated
teams (workspaces)** that never see each other's data.

The authoritative description of the product, domain, architecture, and decisions lives in
[`docs/`](docs/README.md). **`docs/` is the source of truth — this file only tells you how to work.**

## Current state

The knowledge base and the phased implementation plan are complete. **No application code exists
yet.** Build it one phase at a time following [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/README.md).

## How to work in this repo

1. **Before implementing a phase**, read, in order:
   - The phase plan in [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/README.md) (e.g. `phase-03-decks.md`).
   - Every feature spec it references in [`docs/features/`](docs/features/).
   - The ADRs it references in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).
   - The relevant architecture docs in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/).
2. **Follow the coding rules** in [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/):
   - [`coding-standards.md`](.claude/rules/coding-standards.md)
   - [`testing.md`](.claude/rules/testing.md)
   - [`git-and-commits.md`](.claude/rules/git-and-commits.md)
   - [`security-and-tenancy.md`](.claude/rules/security-and-tenancy.md)
   - [`data-sources.md`](.claude/rules/data-sources.md)
3. **Use the project skills** in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) — especially `implementing-a-phase`
   and `adding-a-feature-module`.
4. **When something is unclear, ask.** Do not guess at requirements. Keep `docs/` correct: if you change
   a decision, update the doc and the ADR in the same commit.

## Non-negotiables (the short list — full detail in the rules and ADRs)

- **Tenant isolation is a security property.** Every domain row is scoped by `teamId`; scoping is
  enforced **server-side** from the authenticated session, never from a client-supplied value. No
  endpoint may return cross-team data. See [`docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Explicit, readable names.** Never abbreviate variables, functions, or identifiers. Names reflect the
  business domain (`confidenceWeight`, not `cw`).
- **Test-first and well tested.** No feature is "done" without meaningful tests, including tenant-isolation
  tests. See [`docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md).
- **No scraping.** External decks are referenced by link only; card data comes from sanctioned open
  sources. Respect every third party's terms of service. See [ADR-0007](docs/decisions/0007-external-data-approach.md).
- **Decks are links, not card lists.** The app is not a deck builder. See [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-decks-as-links.md).
- **Prefer current documentation.** For any library/framework/API choice, check current (2026) official
  docs rather than relying on memory — the ecosystem moves fast.

## Planned layout (created in phase-00; do not pre-create)

```
apps/
  web/        # React + Vite SPA (PWA)
  api/        # NestJS backend
packages/
  shared/     # Zod schemas + TypeScript types shared by web and api
docs/         # This knowledge base (source of truth)
.claude/      # Rules, skills, settings for agents
docker-compose.yml
```

## Commands (will exist after phase-00; documented here as the intended contract)

- `pnpm install` — install workspace dependencies
- `pnpm dev` — run web + api in watch mode
- `pnpm test` — run unit/integration tests (Vitest)
- `pnpm test:e2e` — run end-to-end tests (Playwright)
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` — static checks
- `pnpm --filter api prisma migrate dev` — apply database migrations
- `docker compose up` — run the full self-hosted stack

Keep this section in sync with reality as phases land.
